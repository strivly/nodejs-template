# ADR-001: Use of Architectural Decision Records (ADR)

## Status
Accepted

## Context
As our project grows, we need a structured approach to document key architectural decisions. Without proper documentation, past decisions may be revisited unnecessarily, leading to inefficiencies and inconsistencies in our architecture. A well-maintained record of architectural decisions helps in knowledge sharing, onboarding, and maintaining a clear rationale for design choices.

## Decision
We will adopt **Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)** as the standard format for documenting architectural decisions.

### ADR Format
Each ADR will follow the format:

1. **Title**: A descriptive name for the decision.
2. **Status**: The current status of the ADR (e.g., Proposed, Accepted, Rejected, Superseded).
3. **Context**: The background and reasons leading to the decision.
4. **Decision**: The choice made and why.
5. **Consequences**: The impact and trade-offs of this decision.

ADRs will be stored in the `docs/adr/` directory within the project repository and named sequentially as `ADR-<number>-<title>.md`.

## Consequences
- **Pros**:
  - Provides a clear history of architecture decisions.
  - Helps onboard new team members efficiently.
  - Avoids revisiting past decisions without justification.
  - Encourages well-thought-out design choices.

- **Cons**:
  - Requires discipline in maintaining ADRs.
  - Can become outdated if not reviewed periodically.

To mitigate the downsides, we will conduct periodic reviews to update ADRs as needed.

## Alternatives Considered
1. **No formal documentation** – Leads to inconsistent decisions and lack of historical context.
2. **Wiki or Confluence pages** – Provides a centralized place for documentation but lacks version control benefits.
3. **Embedded decisions in code comments** – Helpful for small decisions but not sufficient for high-level architecture choices.

## Next Steps
- Establish an `adr` directory in the repository.
- Educate team members on writing and maintaining ADRs.
- Adopt an ADR review process as part of architectural discussions.

This ADR sets the foundation for structured decision-making in our project.
