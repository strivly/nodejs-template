# nodejs-template

Here's a clean and reusable Node.js Express.js blueprint for microservices. You can extend it further as needed.

This template includes:

- Express.js setup with helmet for security and morgan for logging.
- API Key Authentication Middleware that checks for a valid key in the x-api-key header.
- Healthz Route.
- Global Error Handling.
- Dockerfile
- Helm Chart

You can now use this as a boilerplate for all your Node.js microservices! ðŸš€
